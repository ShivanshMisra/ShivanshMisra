# The files ...
So right now, there are 4 files `kali-windowdecorations.tar` , `flatpak-fonts-setup.sh` , `system-configurations.tar.gz` and `local.conf.example` in here.
1. The first one is just a (Kde Plasma) Window decoration theme I extracted from Kali Linux. (It is compressed as a .tar)
2. The second file is just a script(you have to `chmod +x` it) to setup flatpak <-> system font integration in a bad kind of way! (It does contain Usage Instructions in it)
3. The third file are some system configuration files, for system performance. There are usage instructions in it, in the form of `setup.md`.
4. The fourth and final file is a sample fontconfig file. It contains usage instruction in it!

# Why are they here!?
There is a simple answer to this question:
- Since they serve no purpose, and they aren't code(I am not a developer, I am just a product of retrograde evolution of man!) they are worthless, and kept here for the time being...
- The Script in particular can be greatly improved with memoization, but I am dumb and lazy too, so no work will be done on it for the time being!
