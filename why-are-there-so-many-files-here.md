# The files ...
So right now, there are 2 files `kali-windowdecorations.tar` and `flatpak-fonts-setup.sh` in here.
- The first one is just a (Kde Plasma) Window decoration theme I extracted from Kali Linux. (It is compressed as a .tar)
- The second file is just a script(you have to chmod +x it) to setup flatpak<->system font integration! (It does contain usage Instructions)
- PS: there is a third file but it is a companion to the fonts-setup script.

# Why are they here!?
There is a simple answer to this question:
- Since they serve no purpose, and they aren't code(I am not a developer, I am just a product of retrograde evolution of man!) they are worthless, and kept here for the time being...
