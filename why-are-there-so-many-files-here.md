So right now, there are 2 files `kali-windowdecoration.so` and `flatpak-fonts-setup.sh`
- The first one is just a window decoration theme i extracted from Kali Linux (It is compressed as a .tar.gz)
1 That archive has a "README.md" in it that contains some crude instructions for how2use it!
- The second file is just a script to setup flatpak<->system font integration!
